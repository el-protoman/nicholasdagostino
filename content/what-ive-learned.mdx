RPA - Monitoring Dashboard
+ This was my first experience working on a full-stack application in a work envrionment. We built a monitoring dashboard that pulled rpa application data from a database and integrated it with graphql to display as tables in the frontend. The frontend was built with React and NextJS.
+ Succesfully setup CI/CD for the first time from a mono repo
+ Deployed Dev/Prod versions of the app to Azure resources
+ Setup multiple database connections with TypeORM
+ Lifted state for some of the components to have cleaner code
+ Challenges included setting timezone for the dashboard since the resource and data were in different locations, conditionally rendering some of the table rows with css based on the value inside, having up to date metrics summary tiles based on the filtering of the table (we passed the state for visibleData)
